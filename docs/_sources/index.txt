kRPC Documentation
==================

kRPC allows you to control Kerbal Space Program from external scripts running
outside of the game. It comes with a `Python client library
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/krpc>`_.

Its design is programming language and runtime agnostic. This means you can
interact with it from any programming language that can communicate over a TCP
connection, and you can run your program using any compiler/interpreter/virtual
machine you like.
