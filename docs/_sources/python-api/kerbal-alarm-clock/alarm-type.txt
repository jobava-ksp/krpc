      path. This node will be stored and can be restored when you come back to
      the ship.

   .. data:: apoapsis

      An alarm for furthest part of the orbit from the planet.

   .. data:: periapsis

      An alarm for nearest part of the orbit from the planet.

   .. data:: ascending_node

      Ascending node for the targeted object, or equatorial ascending node.

   .. data:: descending_node

      Descending node for the targeted object, or equatorial descending node.

   .. data:: closest

      An alarm based on the closest approach of this vessel to the targeted
      vessel, some number of orbits into the future.

   .. data:: contract
   .. data:: contract_auto

   .. data:: launch_rendevous

      An alarm that fires as your landed craft passes under the orbit of your
      target.

   .. data:: soi_change
   .. data:: soi_change_auto

      An alarm manually based on when the next SOI point is on the flight path
      or set to continually monitor the active flight path and add alarms as it

   .. data:: transfer
   .. data:: transfer_modelled

      An alarm based on Interplanetary Transfer Phase Angles -- i.e. when should
      I launch to planet X? Based on Kosmo Not's post and used in Olex's
